    """
    Frequency-cued oscillator / sine generation -- a limit-cycle task
    (Sussillo & Abbott, 2009).

    Plain version: the input names a frequency (a single number); the network
    must then produce a steady oscillation at that frequency and keep it going.
    The output is a point travelling around the unit circle, (cos(w*t),
    sin(w*t)) -- a fast w spins quickly, a slow w crawls. A correct solution is
    a *limit cycle* (a stable periodic orbit) in latent space: the rotation /
    "loop" counterpart to the flip-flop's discrete fixed points / "stars".

    Why it probes nonlinearity: a linear system can oscillate at ONE fixed
    frequency, but (1) producing a *cued, tunable* frequency from a constant
    input and (2) a *self-correcting, amplitude-stable* oscillation both need a
    genuine nonlinear limit cycle -- a near-linear rotation is marginally stable
    and single-frequency.

    Timeline:
    - Context: fixation on; frequency cue on; not scored.
    - Response: fixation off (go); frequency cue still on; output oscillates and
      is scored.

    Channels:
    - INPUT (2): channel 0 = fixation; channel 1 = freq_level in [0, 1] (the
      cued frequency, held the whole trial). Padded to BASE_INPUT_DIM=7.
    - OUTPUT: channel 0 = fixation; channels 1, 2 = (cos, sin) of the phase.
    - NOTE: input channel 1 (freq) and output channel 1 (cos) are DIFFERENT
      things -- inputs and outputs are separate tensors that share only the
      index, never data. cos/sin live on output channels 1,2 to match the
      battery-wide angular convention (accuracy reads atan2(ch2, ch1)).
    - LOSS / ACCURACY: loss_channels = [1, 2]. Loss = shared masked MSE;
      accuracy = per-timestep angular match (is_copytask branch): fraction of
      response steps whose phase is within threshold of the target.
